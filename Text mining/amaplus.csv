0,Avinash,all-in-one Package,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a version of the game that includes the base game and all DLC so it's definitely a great buy. The DLC is on a voucher that expires August 28, 2022. So there is no reason to buy this if you already own the first vanilla release.About the game:Best Spider-man game to date in terms of story and gameplay. Game takes around 15-20 hours to complete depending on your skill and how fast you intend to rush through the main story campaign. To collect everything and get platinum trophy it can take upwards to 40 hours. Overall, had a blast playing this game. If you're a fan of Spider-man or super hero games in general; it's a must buy."
1,ROHIT ROY,love this game ‚ù§Ô∏è,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


  ¬†awsome game spiderman only available on ps4 consoles, i love this game ‚ù§Ô∏è must buy amd play this game üòç"
2,Vibhor,DLC code not working,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The DLC code is not working and the cd is of middle east region. Returning the same.
3,Ashish vinayak.s,Incredible,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Wow its was incredible...the packaging looks great...and the graphics are incredible...
4,Mads,Fantastic game and a recommended buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Delivery was spot on. Ordered it on 20th Jan 11am and was delivered on the same day 5pm. Coming to the product, this is a genuine region 2 copy of spiderman with dlc code which works with Indian Psn account. Would strongly recommend indian PSN users to buy this without worrying about the code issue. The game is spectacular in terms of swinging mechanism and graphics. The combat  part may get boring as you will be facing similar thugs most of the time but try out different suits and suit abilities to keep it interesting. Overall a strong 4.8/5"
5,Shubham Mohanty,Amazing,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  üî∏Hands down one of the best PS4 games u can play. Everything from the swinging to the combat feels so fluid, you actually feel like you're Spiderman ! (A must have if ur a fan of ‚ÄúSpiderman‚Äù or ‚ÄúBatman Akham series‚Äù)üî∏The delivery from Amazon was lightning fast, received it in one day. The dlc code also worked without any problems.üî∏U get the following missions in the dlc :  ‚Ä¢ The Heist  ‚Ä¢ Turf Wars  ‚Ä¢ Silver Liningüî∏ It takes about 17 hrs to complete the main story, and the dlc adds 3 hrs of extra gameplay. (But feel free to free roam around the city you'll enjoy every minute of it)."
6,Rachit M.,Middle East disc sent,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I was sent a Africa and middle East licenced only product. To play DLC Indian region licenced disc is required. Waste of time. Replacement ordered. Prospective buyers beware.
7,Sarath Kumar,Be the Spider-Man,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Okay, handsdown the best spiderman game. Hell, best marvel game I would say. Even though developers have definitely took inspiration from Batman Arkahm franchise the combat in this feels fresh, the all different suit which you yourself can unlock without giving any money or as an pre-booking bonus feels very good. Also game is filled with Spider-Man Lore/comics reference. Expecting a sequel for this very spiderman-y game which does justice to both comics, has a fresh take on Spidey and villains we loved watching growing up. My rating is 9.2/10 . Minus .7 for being a small game and not including venom suit(for which they have some franchising ideas)"
8,Michael_Corvin,Game & Season Pass works on indian PSNas well,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Ordered the product yesterday and got it today in the morning which was pretty amazing and that's also without Amazon prime. Anyway, for those who are worried that the season pass  works or not, the season pass code works and from the cover looks like it's from the middle east but the code for season pass inside the case ""will activate for Indian PSN accounts"". I've tried it myself and it works like a charm.Note: No censorship or anything in this game  unlike how it's with Assassins Creed Odyssey since it's from the middle east."
9,awe_flaw_some,"DLC code works, Disc works . All in English",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  After buying there was lot of apprehension as  this disc turned out to be R2 disc but it is imported by Sony India and Disc and DLC code all works fine. I was able to redeem code with my India PSN account and once all updates were done able to claim DLC content for free and download. I can only access the DLC content once I have completed one of the mission in main story, till then it is locked to play.But everything works. I am not sure why other people are saying that DLC code doesnt work for them. I chose cloudtail India as the seller may be thats why it worked for me"
10,Mihir Tyagi,Guide to redeem DLC code,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was a little skeptical before buying it because of mixed reviews whether the code will work in this edition or not. However, i bought it and got the game today and the code is working absolutely fine. After redeeming the code you will get a message that u got an Avtar. To download DLCs just go to ps store, search them  and click X on ur controller then you will get the download option. Download it and enjoy the game."
11,Bhavani,Disappointment.. Code doesn‚Äôt work.. pls don‚Äôt buy..,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Never buy. The main code for the game of the year edition given is not valid.Waster of money. 0 star to be given as i dont have option i have given 1 star.Very disappointed from amazon
12,Mohit Singh,DLC code is working. December 2019 review,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Guys just purchased this game few minutes ago and the first thing is I've tried to redeem the code. It works.Don't know about the CD though but as of now, DLC code is working."
13,Rubik Azariah,Superb game but check the region before you opt for the GOTY edition,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great game, however the DLC for the Game of the Year Edition is tied to region 2 - which means it works for  Western Europe, the Middle East, South Africa, Egypt, and Japan. So just buy a standard version of the game and buy your DLC from you PS Store and save the grief. I will ultimately have to resort to that as there is no way to swap this DLC code.If you are a fan of the Arkham Batman games this will be equally good."
14,Violinist Sachin Satija,Its really awesome,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Wow , Amazing Game, you would not get bored in it for a minute,Web slinging is amazingFighting with enemies and many combosUnlocking suits is easy as you progressExtra side missions like Car chases , puzzles , photography and many more"
15,Vishal P.,Works well,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Even though the disc seems to be imported from Region 2 (R2 on the disc case suggests that which is the PSN code for middle east), the game works fine. Discs are not region locked.DLC is also working. So maybe they're getting the discs from region 2 and swapping out the DLC codes with Indian ones.Anyway, everything seems to work. 4 DLCs are offered which in total add up to about 12-15GB of downloads."
16,Akshit Gupta,Best Spiderman Game Ever,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:Most accurate portrayal of Spiderman/Peter ParkerGreat StoryBest Swinging SystemBig collection of suits and  gadgets and abilitiesGood boss fights(except task master)Cons:Side missions are repetitive and get boring fastFight mechanics could be improvedA lot of the gameplay feels very similar to the Arkham GamesOverall: It's the best Spiderman game I've ever played. It's fun and will keep you engaged for a long time especially if you have all the DLC's and decide to go for the Platinum Trophy .Main Playthrough will last 15-16 hours and completing the game in it's entirety could take you upto 30-35 hours ...if you play at a leisurely rate like myself. If you add in the DLC's, that's another 10-12 hours .I bought the Game of the Year Edition for 1500. It comes with all the DLC's (will have to be downloaded separately along with a game update ..it's around 30gb ...keep that in mind before purchasing)  and so to have a game that lasts around 40-50 hours, is based on one of your favourite characters and is totally fun, is well worth the money spent."
17,Sanjay kumar,The solution for DLC not working,4.0 out of 5 stars,  The game is great and awesome to play.The solution for dlc not working is after redeeming code go to ps store and search spiderman ps4 then go to the last of the page selecting add ons and yoy can see that All DLC are free to downlod
18,Balaharimurthy,Gooood game ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Excellent game and got in a day after ordering.In order to activate the Game of the Year, please put in the DLC code that comes in the cd box.Super graphicsSTORY will be usual one and You'll be able to play as Peter Parker , MJ and Mile Morale ( on select levels )"
19,Abilash km,Great products.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The product was delivered on time and the packing was good. But the CD came out of the holder but not even an single scratch  on the disk. The dcl pack works and I have used the code. It works pretty well I didn't have any problems while playing it. You childhood dreams come true by swinging across the city as spider man. Nice story line till what I have played really loved it.
20,Ashwani Kumar,Go For It!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The game was delivered on time! I faced no issues with the DLC Code or with the Installation of the game, Also the gameplay is great, awesome game.You need to Put the DLC Code in PS Store, and then download the content inside the DLC from the PS Store."
21,Vipin,Become the Spiderman.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Awesome game. The action is great. The web swinging from one place to other itself is just superb, you are gonna get butterflies falling from buildings. You are really gonna feel that you are Spiderman. The main story of the game is also really good. If I had to nitpick I d say that the side quests seem repetitive but over all you are going to love this game."
22,Amazon Customer,Confusion resolved,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's an awesome game with great gameplay.I don't know why people in the reviews have fuss about the game not being of Indian region because the dlc code,language and gameplay works with Indian region and server.the gameplay is completely in english and dlc works with Indian PSN account.so overall this is a must buy and play game."
23,Amazon Customer,Works Perfectly Fine with DLC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Awesome, I was skeptical after reading some reviews stating it is for Middle East etc. However there was no such caveat, you will have full access to the DLC. However you will need Internet facility to download."
24,paras,Disappointed with product not with the game itself,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The game is very good but as being GOTY edition I expected all DLC and updates on disc but I had to download over 20 GB of update & and dlc code which I had to redeem it.But the game is very good and having a full game and DLC at very low price is very good.
25,Manoj singh,I'm getting hyped after playing this game,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Got it in ‚Çπ2100 amazon great indian festival sale & the game delivery was superfast awesome graphic & textures in game little disappointed that The dlc is not pre-loaded in the disc but you'll get a code inside the box for dlc which will be valid up to 2023 or 22 overall good experience hat's off Spidey & hat's off amazon
26,Gaurav,Still My Friendly Neighbourhood..,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  What's there to say that hasn't already been said about this game. Amazing gameplay, beautiful graphics, Heartwarming story, beautiful potrayal of Peter Parker till date among all forms of media, excellent side characters. Plus on top of all this, the game of the year edition gives you instant access to all the DLCs for the game."
27,rajesh s.,Awesome Game,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Truly an amazing game(no pun intended). Easily the best spiderman game out there, amazing graphics, fluid combat and a variety of suits to choose from including the movie suits. An approx 20 GB update is needed to unlock some new suits for free like Sam Raimi suit, future foundation,bombastic bag man and both far from home suits. Had no problem redeeming DLC codes. DLC however also needs to be downloaded additionally. Overall a really great and enjoyable game with an incredible story."
28,Manohar Kanapaka,Bang for buck,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Amazing gameplay. Power moves and amazing storyline too. You can finish the game in like 1/2 weeks at a casual pace. Bonus content is available with this edition.

32,Shadab,Not my type of game,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Bought this after all the hype but the game just didn't do it for me . Maybe iam too old for this type of stuff. Swinging around new york looks cool at first but just gets old very fast . Lost interest and stopped playing after few hours.

39,Mrinal Mukund,Don't worry about the DLC code,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It may look like that that the disk is from another region and the DLC code will not work with Indian PSN account, but don't worry because this is the disk which they have officially launched in India and the DLC code works just fine. Just follow the instructions or check on Youtube about how to redeem and download the DLCs.. And the game is fantastic.."
40,Drieza,Great game!! Must for Playstation player.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Amazing Game!! üëè Really and throughly enjoyed it. Hope it was longer but that just because it was too good. DLC should have been in the disc, DLC data wasn't too big to fit into that CD."

309,Arpith Raj,Beautiful game,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Initial review: Superb.
310,Prince Smith,THE BEST VERSION OF THE BEST SUPERHERO GAME OF ALL TIME,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The Game of the Year Edition of this game which is newly released is without a doubt the ideal version to buy right now. It contains the base game + all the DLC content at a reasonable price which is excellent. Buying the standard edition won't give you any extra content or additional storylines, it will just include the base game. So obviously there is no need to buy the old/standard edition of this game!Now, about the game...It's already the highest selling superhero game ever created, and I predict that it's about to become the highest selling PS4 exclusive game of all time (it's sitting just behind Uncharted 4). The gameplay is ridiculously awesome!What are you waiting for???"
311,CJ Brothers,Disappointed,5.0 out of 5 stars,  No doubt this is an awesome game. I've waited so long for the GOTY edition. I am disappointed because DLC is not on disc. There is DLC code voucher.

The dlc code is easy to redeem.. took less than 1 mins to redeem ! No scratches no dents.. If you're getting it at 40-50% off just get itPros:Epic visualsAwesome actionsNice storylineCon:Repetitive missionsgraphics look kinda meh after playing miles Moralesno adaptive trigger support

314,Rituparna Baruah,Masterpiece ü§©ü§©ü§©,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  My first PS4 game, bought it since I am Spidey fanboy since childhood. Have played all Spidey Games but hands down to this title. It is way 100x more better than all the Spider Man games combined. I bought a PS4 only for playing this title, maybe the best decision I have ever took. This game is such a joy because once you start playing it you can't get your hands off this game. If you are true Spidey fan just go for it. Marvel's Spiderman is one of the best open world game and the best superhero game of all time in my opinion."
